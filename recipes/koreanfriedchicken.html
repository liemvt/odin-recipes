        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>It took about two decades for this style of Korean fried chicken to make its way into the 
            American foodie scene. The chicken is deep fried twice to make the exterior extra crispy 
            and to lock moisture in. The gochujang sauce is a hot, honey, spicy mix...and well, it's 
            just fabulous. You'll have the family completely raving!</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

            <li>Add chicken pieces to the hot oil about 5 pieces at a time so as not to drop the 
                temperature of the oil - Fry for 2 minutes. </li>
            <li>Transfer chicken to a plate lined with paper towels to drain.</li>

            <li>Transfer to a plate lined with paper towels to drain.</li>
            <li>Repeat with the second batch of chicken pieces.</li>
            <li>Transfer chicken to a medium-sized serving bowl. </li>
            <li>Heat a small saucepan over medium-low heat.</li>
            <li>Add honey, brown sugar, soy sauce, gochujang paste, Worcestershire sauce, red pepper flakes, 
                and ginger.</li> 
            <li>Cook and stir continuously until sugar has melted and sauce is smooth, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Drizzle sauce over twice-fried chicken tenders and serve.</li>
        </ol>
